Thanks for submitting an idea for improvement!

This repo is for feedback specific to the Azure Kinect ROS Driver. If you have feedback for the Sensor SDK, please visit https://github.com/microsoft/Azure-Kinect-Sensor-SDK

Feature requests on our GitHub page should be for changes to the driver that will improve functionality for all users.

Tips to submit an enhancement that may be approved: 
 - The idea should fit with the purpose of the Azure Kinect ROS Driver, which is to expose Azure Kinect sensor data in a ROS-compatible format. Post-processing of the sensor data should be done in external ROS nodes. 
 - Well thought out ideas considering edge cases and API design will be more likely for someone to pursue.
